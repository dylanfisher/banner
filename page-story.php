				<p>Alex Banner has been a builder and craftsman for 10 years. He is the founder of Wishbone Woodworking, a successful Greenpoint Brooklyn-based woodworking studio specializing in custom millwork. Alex approached A&O to help him build a new revenue stream in his business and to brand the company to be known for Alex’s true passion: hand crafted furniture design.</p>
				<p>Tina Banner is Alex’s wife and a former printmaker with a background in art and design. Tina made the transition to working with Alex as his business partner at Wishbone Woodworking and has been working with A&O to market the furniture side of the business.</p>
				<p>Alex and Tina have decided to launch the furniture business together as a husband-and-wife design team, keeping Wishbone Woodworking in existence as the millwork shop that is their bread and butter. The new furniture business will be called, “Banner” and will be presented at ICFF in May 2014.</p>
